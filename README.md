# Brain MRI Synthesis and Tumor Detection

A deep learning project leveraging **Deep Convolutional GANs (DC-GAN)** for generating synthetic MRI images and **DenseNet121** for brain tumor classification. This project addresses dataset limitations through synthetic image augmentation, significantly improving classification accuracy.

---

## Overview

This project employs:
1. **DC-GAN**: Generates high-quality synthetic MRI images to augment the dataset.
2. **DenseNet121**: A pre-trained model fine-tuned for binary classification (tumor or no tumor).

By combining synthetic data and deep learning classification, the project achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in tumor detection.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Brain MRI Images for Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)
- **Structure**:
  - `yes/`: MRI images with tumors.
  - `no/`: MRI images without tumors.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Resized images to \(128 \times 128\).
  - Normalized pixel values to the range [0, 1].
  - Augmented data using rotation, flipping, and zooming to enhance the dataset.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Model Architectures**:
  - DC-GAN for synthetic MRI image generation.
  - DenseNet121 for tumor classification.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, OpenCV

## How to Use

### **1. Training the DC-GAN**
To train the GAN for generating synthetic MRI images:
```python
# Import required libraries
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Conv2D, Reshape, Conv2DTranspose, BatchNormalization, Activation, LeakyReLU

# Define the generator and discriminator
generator = define_generator()
discriminator = define_discriminator()

# Compile the GAN
gan = compile_gan(generator, discriminator)

# Train the GAN
train_gan(generator, discriminator, gan, real_images, epochs=50, batch_size=32)
```

---

### **2. Generating Synthetic MRI Images**
To generate new MRI images using the trained GAN:
```python
# Generate synthetic images
noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, (10, noise_dim))
generated_images = generator.predict(noise)

# Display the generated images
plot_images(generated_images, title="Synthetic MRI Images")
```

---

### **3. Training the Tumor Classifier**
Fine-tune the DenseNet121 model for binary tumor classification:
```python
# Import DenseNet121
from tensorflow.keras.applications import DenseNet121
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Load DenseNet121 with pre-trained weights
base_model = DenseNet121(weights="imagenet", include_top=False, input_shape=(128, 128, 3))

# Add custom classification layers
model = Sequential([
    base_model,
    Flatten(),
    Dense(256, activation="relu"),
    Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="binary_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])

# Train the classifier
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, validation_data=(val_data, val_labels), epochs=20, batch_size=32)
```

---

### **4. Evaluating the Classifier**
Evaluate the trained DenseNet121 model on the test dataset:
```python
# Evaluate the model
results = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {results[1]*100:.2f}%")
```

---

## Results

### Synthetic Data Quality
The synthetic data generated by DC-GAN was evaluated using:
- **Frechet Inception Distance (FID):** To measure the similarity between real and synthetic MRI images.

### Tumor Classification Performance
| Metric       | Value  |
|--------------|--------|
| Accuracy     | 96%    |
| Precision    | 93%    |
| Recall       | 97%    |
| F1-Score     | 95%    |

## Future Improvements

- **Advanced GAN Architectures**: Use StyleGAN for generating more realistic synthetic images.
- **Multi-class Classification**: Extend the project to classify tumor types.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Add interpretability to predictions for better insights.
- **Real-time Deployment**: Optimize the model for real-time inference on edge devices.
